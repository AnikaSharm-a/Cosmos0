# CosmosView
ICS 4UI SE Project
CosmosView is a night-sky viewer program that simulates telescope use and allows its users to enjoy the night sky from their computer. 
The user can choose a celestial body in the universe (the moon, planets, stars, etc.) from a drop-down menu to view through the telescope.
